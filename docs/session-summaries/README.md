2. Add a short one-line description at the top and a summary of code changes, tests, and next steps.
3. Add a line to this `README.md` index (alphabetical or chronological order) linking the new file.

Suggested fields inside each session summary

- Date & participants
- Goals and accepted criteria
- Code changes (files and purpose)
